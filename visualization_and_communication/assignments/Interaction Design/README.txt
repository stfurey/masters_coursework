This visualization implements elaborate, filter and encode interactions. 

The elaborate interaction is showcased via tooltips which provides the ball park and exact values for each axis for each data point.
The filter interaction is a dropdown which allows the user to select which fence distance to plot.
The encode interaction is the view dropdown which allows the user to switch between a scatter plot of each stadium and a bar plot with the center field distances binned by 5ft intervals and showing average HR Park effect for each distance.

The elaborate interaction was chosen as it allowed me to provide a third dimension to each data point. Allowing the user to better understand the data being plotted.
The filter interaction was chosen to allow the user to discover the differences between fence lengths and if one fence correlates to park effect more than others.
The encode interaction was chosen to allow the user to see the distribution better and realize that there are more than one factor that contributes to a parks HR effect.
